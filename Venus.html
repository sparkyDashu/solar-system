<h2>Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty. 
<h2> As the brightest natural object in Earth's night sky after the Moon, Venus can cast shadows and can be,
on rare occasions, visible to the naked eye in broad daylight.
<h2>Venus lies within Earth's orbit, and so never appears to venture far from the Sun,
either setting in the west just after dusk or rising in the east a little while before dawn.
<h2>Venus orbits the Sun every 224.7 Earth days.
