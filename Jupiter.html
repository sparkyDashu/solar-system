<h2>Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System.
<h2>It is a gas giant with a mass more than two and a half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined,
but slightly less than one-thousandth the mass of the Sun.
<h2>Jupiter is the third-brightest natural object in the Earth's night sky after the Moon and Venus.
<h2>It has been observed since pre-historic times and is named after the Roman god Jupiter, the king of the gods, because of its observed size.
