<h2>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor and support life.
<h2> About 29.2% of Earth's surface is land consisting of continents and islands.
<h2> The remaining 70.8% is covered with water, mostly by oceans, seas, gulfs, and other salt-water bodies,
but also by lakes, rivers, and other freshwater, which together constitute the hydrosphere. 
<h2> Much of Earth's polar regions are covered in ice.
