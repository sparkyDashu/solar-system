<h2>The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma,
heated to incandescence by nuclear fusion reactions in its core, radiating the energy mainly as visible light, ultraviolet light, and infrared radiation.
<h2>It is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth.
<h2> Its diameter is about 1.39 million kilometres (864,000 miles), or 109 times that of Earth.
<h2> Its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth; it accounts for about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System.
